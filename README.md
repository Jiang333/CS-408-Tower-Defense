Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to create a tower defense game in which players are able to not only build defenses to ward off enemies, but also be on the offensive by spending resources to deploy their own troops. Often when we have played tower defense type games in the past, there was only one objective: to build enough to defeat all waves of enemies. However, we plan to twist the gameâ€™s fundamentals to achieve a more modern style of gameplay.
